# IoT Lab Game

This is a basic web application built using Flask and sqlite that handles checkins for a "Capture the Flag" style game in an IoT lab. The idea is that student teams will build and configure their networks and the checkin application is used to verify that they reach the server. The application shows the checkins ordered by the first check in to the last to provide a leaderboard.
